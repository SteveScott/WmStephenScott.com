<h2 id='AboutMe'>About Myself</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Steve Scott. I have three core competencies: Code, Geo, and Design</p>

<p><em>Code:</em>  I am skilled in programming in multiple languages, especially Python, Java, C#, R, and SQL. I have experience developing software applications and web applications. I have taken courses in data science, statistics, and machine learning and can implement these techniques in code. I will complete my Master of Computer Science Degree from New Jersey Institute of Technology in May, 2018.</p>

<p><em>Geo:</em> I am proficient in GIS (ESRI and open-source). I can conduct statistical analyses over geospatial datasets and create complex models. I can also make compelling maps. I also know urban geography, including urban economics, land use law, historic growth patterns, and planning theory. I obtained my Master of City Planning from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010.</p>

<p><em>Design:</em> I am trained in urban design and architecture, earning a Certificate in Urban Design from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010. I am skilled in 2d graphics and 3d modeling and texturing. I also have professional experience as a web designer and design my own sites, such as this.</p>

<p>Check out my github page at <a href="https://github.com/SteveScott">github.com/SteveScott</a></p>

<p> have experience in Python, Java, C#, R, and SQL. I use Python and Flask to make my personal websites. One of these sites is <a href="http://www.evepiprofits.com">EVE PI Profits</a>. It aggregates market data for the online game EVE Online. The game has a market economy, with price data. My app pulls from the EVE-Central market data API, applies calculations, and displays the market data for planetary commodities. The front end uses Flask templates with Bootstrap for responsive design.</p>

<p>This site, WmStephenScott.com does not use bootstrap, but consists of custom J-Query scripts for animations and transitions. The backend is also Python and Flask.</p>

<p>I also developed the website <a href="https://rubertones.myshopify.com">rubertones.com </a> for Rubertones CAD and Casting. I also worked extensively on a custom template for <a href="https://www.untildeathinc.com">Until Death Inc.</a> but after I left they changed the site to appeal to women with a new default template (it doesn't represent my work). I have experience with Shopify's Liquid system and got a chance to apply my JavaScript knwoledge.</p>

<p>I took a course in data science from General Assembly, which utilized the SciKitLearn library for Python. I learned how to do cluster analysis, random forest classification and regression, and ordinary least square regression analysis in Python.</p>

<p>I am strong in SQL, having taken three courses in the subject at NJIT. I can execute complex queries using the EXIST clause. I can aggregate and group data. I can alter tables, and add data to them. I am very comfortable with easy queries, and I have the knowledge base to tackle more complex queries. I would like to apply my knowledge of PostGIS.</p>

<p>Java is the primary language at NJIT. I have used Java before to create networking apps that apply Dikstra's Algorithm to the local area network. I am also taking an intermediate-level Java development course in the sumer of 2017.</p>

<p>I have used C# to create a game aid for the board game Attack Vector: Tactical. The damage allocation is complex, so I automated the process with a command line application. I am not averse to the Microsoft stack would like to dive deeper into C# and .NET.</p>

<p>I use R to clean data for use in statistical analysis of real estate data. I have also used it to generate reports for the Provost of Rutgers University.</p>

<p>I am creating add-ons to the open-source game Orbiter 2016 in the C++ language, implementing the Attack Vector rules from the C# application into the real time simulation. I am also creating DLLs to drive the ships that I create for the game. This is an ongoing project.</p>

<p>As you can see I have several projects behind me and I am ready to advance to the next level of my career: finding employment as a junior developer.</p>

<h2 id='Geo'>Geo</h2>

<p>Trained as a city planner I have extensive experience with GIS packages and spatial analysis. I am proficient in both the ESRI products and open source alternatives. I am good with raster analysis using ESRI's Spatial Analyst extension, and I have experience using Business Analyst for facility placement decisions using gravity modeling, as well as for drive-time calculations. I have used GIS to model real estate prices in New Jersey and New York using a variety of geospatial inputs into a linear regression model, and also with machine learning. To do this I used ESRI model builder and custom python scripting to create complex regression models. I have also used GIS and Adobe Illustrator to make cartographic presentation graphics.</p>

<p>I also have advanced training in urban systems. My undergraduate degree was in social science, and my first master's degree was in city planning. I have training in urban economics, micro economics, and macro economics. I understand how the planning process works in city government, planning law, planning theory, and planning history. I took Planning By Numbers with John Landis where I learned how to apply statistical methods towards urban problems.</p>

<p>I also have real estate development training. I learned how to calculate internal rate of return and net present value for real estate developments. I learned the Huff gravity model for retail site location. I have work experience with a non-profit housing developer where I had in-depth training in low income housing tax credits (LIHTC). I have work experience as a project manager overseeing contractors, and experience with quantitative asset management for rental properties. I also know the basics of how a building is made and about architectural styles, theory, history, and process.</p>

<p>My aesthetic preferences are baroque, biophilic, fine-grained, high-tech, yet functional and humane.</p>

<p>I am skilled in both 2D and 3D design. I use 2D design principles to make presentation-grade maps for my employers and their clients. I have graphic design training which I put to use in publications and in my web sites. I am particularly strong in 3d modeling. I know how to create models in 3DS Max, Maya, or Rhino, and texture objects in ZBrush.</p>

<p>I have a certificate in urban design from PennDesign, and am well-versed in the principles of New Urbanism, transit-oriented development, and complete streetscape design. I also have in-depth knowlege of historic design patterns, such as the Radburn design, Ed Bacon's design of Philadelphia, and garden city principles.</p>

<p>One of my interests is algorithmic design and form generation. I have used algorithmic design for building facade concepts, sculpture, and jewelry. I am particularly skillful with cellular automata, agent-based design, and L-systems.</p>
